    Plain text scanner & formatter

    Takes some plain text, and applies some useful formatting to it. This is
    non-disruptive formatting - it will not cause the text to be reflowed,
    and will preserve any manual spacing that the text assumed.

    The markup language used is very Creole-like - **bold** and //italics//,
    for example. Links are done by [[Wiki Page]]. Bugs are linked by #EFORGE-32,
    etc.
