class Update(models.Model):
    """
        The update is a generic class representing all project activities.
        It connects to a model which contains the actual activity data;
        the update object itself contains just the bare minimum information
        required to efficiently display and distribute the updates.
        
        In order to create a new update type, you must create a child class of 
        your model called Update. To this, you must add methods in the form
            def summary(model_object):
                pass
                
        These methods will be invoked when a user queries an instance of the update for your model. You should then construct an Update object with values appropriate to the update being created.
        
        The update will be pushed out to any listeners when you save the object.
        
        .. py:attribute:: user
            The user responsible for the update
            
        .. py:attribute:: project
            The project the update is connected to
            
        .. py:attribute:: date
            The date and time at which the update was created
            (Will be set to the time when the update object was created by
            default; you can override this by providing a date function)
            
        .. py:attribute:: object
            The object containing the main data on the update. This is a content
            types generic relation; it is a composite of (object_type, object_id)
            
        .. py:attribute:: summary
            A short summary of the update, usable for titles and short 
            notifications (e.g. tweets) [proxied]
            
        .. py:attribute:: description
            A more elaborate description of the update, for example, to be used as the body of E-Mail notifications [proxied]
            
        .. py:attribute:: url
            A link which the user can visit to gather more information [proxied]
            
        .. py:attribute:: recipients
            List of users who have expressed interest in direct notification of an update. This is optional; if not specified, none will be assumed
